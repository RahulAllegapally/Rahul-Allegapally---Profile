first

eval_data.txt -> Test data for phrase extraction
script.py -> The scipt.py file has the pipeline for the complete phrase extraction process.
regex_generator.py -> The regex_generator.py creates a python file with a stack of regex patterns for phrase extraction.
training_classifier.py -> The training_classifier.py is used to train the Machine learning model to classify sentences into two groups: 'Found','Not Found'(phrases).  

training_data.tsv -> Labeled sentenses for phrase extraction.



After running script.py

regex_matcher.py -> This file is used to extract the phrases from the eval_data.txt

Bag_of_Words_model_new.csv -> Output of the classifier on the test data without passing it through the phrase extractor.

my_classifier.pickle -> Saving our trained model

my_vectorizer.pickle -> Saving our vectorizer model

output.txt -> The output of the extraction using the regex_matcher.py without passing it through the classifier. 

submission.csv -> The final submission once the test sentences are passed through both the classifier and phrase extracter.
